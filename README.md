# DevCamper

Worked on my Rest-API building skills. Looked around a bit and thought how about recreating a whole project from ground up using a totaly different tech-stack and then I came to conculsion that django and django-rest-framework is a deadly combination that goes head to against ME_N stacks.

## Usage

## Install Dependencies

```
pip install django djangorestframework
```

## Run App

```
# Run in dev mode
cd src/devcamper_project
python manage.py runserver
```

## Demo

The API is live at [devcamper.io](https://devcamper.io) built by Brad Traversy using Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js.

This is repo is nothing but the recreation of the same project using the tech-stack(I'm familiar): django, djangorestframework only.
